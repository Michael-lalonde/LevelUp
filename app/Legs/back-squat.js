        <li>
          Load a barbell on your traps and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your gaze forward, chest proud, and toes slightly pointed out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sit back into your hips, bend your knees, and lower toward the floor. Make sure your knees move slightly out and don’t collapse inward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground — or as far down as your mobility allows — then push back up to the starting position.
