          Begin to hinge forward at your hips, lowering your weight toward the ground with a slight bend in your knees. Allow the weights to closely follow the line of your legs, and lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.

          Pause, then drive your hips forward to stand up, allowing your glutes to power the movement.
