          <li>
          To set up, hold a dumbbell vertically and grip it with both hands underneath the top of the weight. Position the dumbbell against your chest and keep it in contact throughout the movement.
          </li>
          <li>
          Begin to squat, sitting back into your hips and bending your knees. Keep your torso up and lower down as far as your mobility allows.

          <li>
          Push up through your heels back to the starting position.
