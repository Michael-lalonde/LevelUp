          <li>
          Sit on an elevated surface like a bench or sofa and place a barbell, dumbbell, or plate on your hips. Youâ€™ll have to support the weight with your hands throughout the movement.
          </li>
          <li>
          To set up, scoot your back down the bench with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground shoulder-width apart. Your legs should form a 90-degree angle, and the bench should be positioned right below your shoulder blade.
          </li>
          <li>
          Keep your chin tucked and drop your butt down toward the ground. Lower down while keeping your feet stationary, stopping once your torso forms a 45-degree angle with the ground.
          </li>
          <li>
          Push up through your heels until your thighs are parallel to the floor again. Squeeze your glutes at the top, then return to the starting position.
          </li>
        </ol>
