        <h4>Start by standing with your feet together.</h4>
        <h4>Take a big step forward with your left foot so that you are in a staggered stance.</h4>
        <h4>Bend your left knee and drop into a lunge, keeping your right leg straight behind you with your toes on the ground so you feel a stretch at the front of your right thigh.</h4>
        <h4>Place your right hand on the floor and twist your upper body to the left as you extend your left arm toward the ceiling.</h4>
        <h4>Hold for at least 30 seconds.</h4>
        <h4>Repeat on the other side.</h4>
